# Mocha-testing

This is a very basic mocha testing application.
It takes in an object and makes a copy of the same.
The main focus is testing here.
To run this application first you need to make sure that your system has mocha installed.

*******************
If mocha is not installed, write command in command line 'npm install -global mocha'.
Also Make sure you have node and npm installed.
*******************

After completing basic setup, run command 'npm test' to start testing the functionality.
